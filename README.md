# Stats140SL-Project

This was the final project for my UCLA Statistics 140SL class, Practice of Statistical Consulting. My team and I came up with the research question analyzing if and how traffic collisions and burglaries from vehicles changed between 2010 and 2017. I primarily handled traffic collisions, as can be seen in my data. This project dealt with data cleaning, exploratory analysis, external analysis, and regression analysis.
